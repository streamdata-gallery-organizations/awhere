  title: aWhere Agronomic Values & Accumulations
  description: "####Request\nThis API call gets calculated agronomics and accumulations
    at a field location. \n\nThe URL used here will get the values for a certain range
    of days. This is a very flexible API and so you're encouraged to review the [Agronomics
    Documentation](http://developer.awhere.com/api/reference/agronomics/values).\n\n_Tip:
    Remember to use a field ID that exists in your account. By default, this collection
    uses a default field ID of 'field1'_\n\n\n####Security\nThis API call uses the
    security Access Token that is retrieved with the \"Get a Token\" request. If you
    run that request first, it will save a token to Postman and this API will use
    it automatically. You can also see where the token should normally go by clicking
    the \"Headers\" tab below. The Authorization header holds the token, replacing
    the \"{{aWhereAccessToken}}\" part."
